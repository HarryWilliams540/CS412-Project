Write-up:

The Traveling Salesman Problem is important because of how many real world applications can be modeled as the 
problem. For instance, it can obviously be used for delivery by major companies like FedEx or UPS, as they want
to efficiently deliver packages without driving through the same places multiple times. I also found it useful
for things such as manufacturing hardware, as robots can figure out the best path for drilling holes or 
soldering things, and also image compression.
